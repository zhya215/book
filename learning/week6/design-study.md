# Design Pattern Change Study

Our team decided to look at changes in the design and shape of skis, because it is an area that has been changing drastically over the past few decades. In order to gather data, we could collect information from manufacturers on all of their models. This data would include specifications like the tip, tail, and underfoot width, turning radius, and the rocker profile. In addition, we would want to look at sales data ideally from both online retailers and local ski shops. In order to analyze the data, we could group ski shapes into different categories, such as park, powder, all mountain, etc. Among other factors, we could look at the changes in popularity of these different categories over time and geography. For example, it is reasonable to expect to see more powder skis on the west coast than the east coast. Additionally, it would be interesting to look at things like changes in the average size of a ski over time.
